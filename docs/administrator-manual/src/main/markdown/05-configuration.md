# Configuration

Now that you have successfully started the SlipStream server, you will
need to configure it.  Most of this configuration can be done through
the web interface.

## Predefined Accounts

The following table describes the predefined accounts for a new
SlipStream installation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
User   Password    Description
-----  ----------  ----------------------------------------------
super  supeRsupeR  The initial administrator account for the 
                   service.  This account can modify the server 
                   configuration and all modules.

sixsq  siXsQsiXsQ  Owner of pre-defined images and tutorials that
                   are "public" and available to all authenticated
                   users.

test   tesTtesT    A test account with standard privileges.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**The passwords for these accounts should be changed immediately.** To
do so log into the server with the "super" account.  After logging in,
click on the "users" icon to see a list of users.  You should see a
list of users like the following screenshot.

Click on the username, then on the "edit" button.  Fill in the new
password (twice) and click "save".  The password will be updated.  Do
this for all three accounts.  Note: For the "super" account you will
have to provide the current password.

## Configuration Parameters

Once the application is installed, a few parameters must be configured
before SlipStream can be used.  To set these parameters click on the
"wrench" icon at the top of the page.  You should see a configuration
page like the following.  Fill in the fields with the correct
information and click on the "save" button.

More information for the setting the parameters for each section is
below.  You can also get more information within the interface by
clicking on the question mark bullet to the right of the parameter.

### Basic and Advanced Parameters

The *SlipStream Basics* and *SlipStream Advanced* configuration section
must be updated to reflect the current installation.  In these sections
replace all occurrences of *example.com* with the appropriate value.
All other parameters, with the exception of the *cloud connector*
value should be kept unchanged.

### Support Parameters

SlipStream needs to send out email notifications, for example when
validating email addresses during user registration.  These parameters
are set in the *SlipStream Support* section.

## Cloud Configuration

On the configuration page, there is one section for each supported
cloud.  If the type of cloud you want to use is not listed, then you
will have to import the plugin for that cloud.

See the documentation for each connector for help on configuring its
parameters.

## SSL Certificate

Sensitive credentials are passed between a user's browser and the
SlipStream server; the metadata describing machines and deployments
may also contain proprietary information and be similarly sensitive.
Consequently, the server must be configured to use SSL. The metadata
describing machines and deployments may also contain

The server will initially start with a self-signed certificate that is
included in the package.  You should either create a self-signed
certificate for your host or better (and strongly recommended) use a
commercial certificate signed by a well-known certificate authority.

### Using a Commercial Certificate

A commercial certificate signed by a well-known certificate authority is
the easiest to configure. These certificates are trusted by default in
most browsers and by most java distributions. Follow the instructions of
your chosen provider to obtain a signed certificate. Usually, this
certificate is delivered in X509 form (`*.pem` file). To use this for
the SlipStream server it must be converted either to PKCS12 for JKS
format.

To convert, the certificate and key into a PKCS12 format do the
following:

    $ openssl pkcs12 -in name.crt -inkey name.key -o name.p12
    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -out name.p12 \
        -inkey name.key \
        -in name.crt \
        -certfile ca-cert.pem 

The resulting file will contain both the certificate and key. Be sure to
remember the password used to secure the PKCS12 file.

To convert the PKCS12 file to JKS (Java Key Store) format, do the
following:

    $ keytool -cert name.crt -key name.key
    $ keytool -v -importkeystore \
        -srckeystore name.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 \
        -destkeystore jetty.jks -deststoretype JKS 

The resulting file will contain both the certificate and key. Be sure to
remember the password used to secure the JKS file.

The resulting keystore must be saved in the file
`/opt/slipstream/etc/jetty.jks`.  You must provide the password in the
file `/opt/slipstream/server/start.d/50-ssl.ini`.  (Replace values for
_all_ of the password parameters!)

After updating the certificate and configuration, restart the
SlipStream server.

### Using a Self-signed Certificate

The advantage of a self-signed certificate is that it can be created
with no cost. The disadvantage is that it is not trusted by default by
web browsers nor by the java distributions. The SlipStream server and
client can be configured to trust the self-signed certificate. Web
browsers will generally warn users that the certificate is not trusted,
but give the user the option to ignore the warning.

Follow the instructions found on the web to create a self-signed
certificate.  Then use the same procedure to install this for the
SlipStream server. 

## Examples

A set of examples that demonstrate the main features of SlipStream
are installed with the `slipstream-client` package on the machine, but
are not installed in the service by default. 

To add those examples to the service, run the command:

    $ ss-module-upload \
        -u sixsq -p PASSWORD \
        --endpoint=https://slipstream.example.com \
        /usr/share/doc/slipstream/*.xml

replacing the password and endpoint with the values for your service.
This will upload all of the examples under the "sixsq" account.  These
will be visible in the "examples" project on the welcome page.
