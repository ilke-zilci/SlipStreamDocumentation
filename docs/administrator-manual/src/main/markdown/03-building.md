# Building SlipStream™

The core of SlipStream™ and some of the cloud plugins are available
under the open source Apache 2 license.  You can download the sources,
compile, and package the service yourself.

If you have bought a commercial license for the software, then a set
of precompiled packages will be provided.  In this case, you can skip
directly to the installation instructions in the next chapter.

## Build Dependencies

These instructions assume that you are building the software on an
**up-to-date, minimal CentOS 6 system**.  The build may work on other
distributions, but you may have to modify the packages or commands to
suit the system you are using.

Several of the packages required for the build are not available in
the core CentOS 6 distribution.  You will need to configure your
machine to use the [EPEL 6 package repository][epel].

EPEL provides an RPM to do the configuration.  Just download the RPM
and install it with `yum`.

    $ wget -nd <URL>
    $ yum localinstall -y <downloaded RPM>

You can find the URL and package name via the information in the "How
can I use these extra packages?" section on the EPEL page.

Most of the build dependencies can be installed directly with `yum`,
although some recent python modules will need to be installed with
`pip`.

The following table describes the RPM packages that must be
installed.  The table also describes how those packages are used
within the build.  A command like:

    $ yum install -y [packages]

will install all of the listed packages.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Package                   Comment
------------------------  ----------------------------------------
java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel  Used to compile and run the server

python                    Needed for client CLI and testing

python-devel              Needed to build some python module
                          dependencies

pylint                    For analysis of python code

python-pip                Used to install python modules

gcc                       Compilation c-bindings for required
                          python modules

pandoc                    Used to generate documentation from
                          Markdown sources 

texlive-latex             Used to generate PDF versions of docs

texlive-xetex             Used to generate PDF versions of docs

git                       Used to checkout source code from 
                          GitHub

rpm-build                 Creates binary distribution packages

createrepo                Create local yum repository from 
                          generated RPM packages
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few python modules that must be installed with `pip`.  The
SlipStream™ code uses options and features that require more recent
versions than those packaged for CentOS 6.  The following table
provides details.  Use the command:

    $ pip install nose coverage paramiko

to install all of these packages.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Package                   Comment
------------------------  ----------------------------------------
nose                      Unit testing utility for python code

coverage                  Coverage testing for python code

paramiko                  SSH library for python
------------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, the overall build is managed with Maven.  You will need to
download the [Maven distribution][mvn-download] (choose the most
recent binary distribution), unpack the distribution and modify the
environment to make the `mvn` command visible.

Once you have downloaded and unpacked Maven, you can setup the
environment with:

    $ export MAVEN_HOME=<installation directory>/apache-maven-3.1.0
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$MAVEN_HOME/bin

The `mvn` command should now be visible.  The software will build with
any maven version later than 2.2.1.

## Checkout Sources

Now that the build environment has been setup, you will need to obtain
the sources from GitHub.  Clone the sources (`git clone`) from the
following repositories into a common directory.  You may need to setup
a `.gitconfig` file for `git`. 

------------------------
Repository              
------------------------
SlipStream

SlipStreamDocumentation

SlipStreamMta

SlipStreamUI

SlipStreamServer

SlipStreamServerDeps

SlipStreamClient
------------------------

The URL for each repository is the name of the repository prefixed by:

    https://github.com/slipstream/

For instance to clone the SlipStream repository, do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStream

This URL will allow read-only clones of the given repository.

## SlipStream Versions

The git repositories will contain a number of branches and tags.  By
default, you will be on the `master` branch which contains the latest
development version.

Most likely you will want to build a specific release.  To find all of
the tagged versions, do:

    $ (cd SlipStream; git tag -l)

Choose the version you want from the list of tags.

Once you've chosen the tag you want to build, checkout the tagged
version of each of the repositories:

    $ export VERSION=2.0.3
    $ for i in SlipStream*; do (cd $i; git checkout $i-$VERSION); done

This will checkout the same version for all of the different modules.

## Build and Package

The build is managed from the SlipStream module.  Change into
the root of that directory and use it as your working directory.
Touch the file `.slipstream-build-all`.  This will signal Maven to do
a complete compilation of all modules.

Just to make sure that everything is working correctly and to start
with a clean slate, do the following:

    $ mvn clean

This should download a bunch of Maven plugins and then finish with a
long list of modules that have been built sucessfully.  If not, you
will need to correct any problems before going on.

Now start the complete build with:

    $ mvn install -DBUILD_NUMBER=1

This will download a large number of build dependencies, but should
eventually end successfully.  The value for the BUILD_NUMBER is
arbitrary, but it must be set for the build to complete successfully.

## Create Local Yum Repository

The easiest way to install the software is with `yum`, so we will
create a local yum repository with all of the generated packages.

In the directory containing all of the checked out repositories,
create a subdirectory called `ss-packages`:

    $ mkdir ss-packages

and then collect all of the generated packages in this directory.  The
shell magic for this is:

    $ find . -name \*.rpm -exec cp {} ./ss-packages/ \; 

It just does a copy for each RPM package it finds. 

Now create the yum metadata for the repository:

    $ createrepo ss-packages

And finally, configure the system to use this local repository.
Create the file `/etc/yum.repos/local.repo` with the contents:

    [local]
    name=local
    baseurl=file:///absolute/path/ss-packages
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

changing the URL to be the one appropriate for your system.  Check
that the created packages are visible:

    $ yum clean all
    $ yum search slipstream-server

The response should indicate that the package was found.  If so, you
are ready for the installation.
