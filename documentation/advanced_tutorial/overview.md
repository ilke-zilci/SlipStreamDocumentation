title: Overview
---

The purpose of this tutorial is to highlight the major features of
SlipStream.  The exercises deal with features that interest
end-users, platform maintainers, and software developers.  As they
build on each other, you will probably want to go through the
exercises in order.

All of the native images and deployments are available in the
"examples" project on the server, assuming that your administrator has
installed them.  The native images reference a StratusLab cloud
infrastructure, but your administrator should have added references
for the cloud infrastructures supported through your SlipStream
service.  You will need to make adjustments depending on the cloud
infrastructure you use.
