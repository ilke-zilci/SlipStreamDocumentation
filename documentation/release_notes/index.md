title: Release Notes
---

Production deployments should use recent stable releases. The latest
**stable release** is **v2.4.2**.

SixSq also produces a **candidate release** after each development
iteration (sprint).  These provide a peek at new features.  Feedback
on these releases is welcome, but they should not be used in
production.
