SlipStream uses a Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) and exposes a
complete REST API over HTTP(S).  To ensure consistency, the service's
web interface directly uses the underlying SlipStream API.

If you're a developer looking to integrate SlipStream into your
application DevOps processes, then direct use of the API will
facilitate that integration.  The [complete API documentation][ssapi]
can be found on a separate, dedicated site.
