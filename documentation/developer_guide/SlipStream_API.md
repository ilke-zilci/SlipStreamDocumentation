title: SlipStream API
---

SlipStream uses a Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) and exposes a
complete REST API.  The service's web interface directly uses the
underlying SlipStream API.

If you're a developer interested only in using the SlipStream API,
then you can find the [complete API documentation][api] on a different
server.
